# Project 1: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the main.Rmd for training the 4 models (randomForest, gbm, logistic regression, and SVM) on the chosen features (rgb, hsv, hog, and sift). The directory also contains training Convolutional Neural Network in Python. 

The separate sift.Rmd shows the steps we've taken to extract the SIFT feature.
